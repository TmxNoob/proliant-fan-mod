## Pinouts:

### DL380P G8
+12V | FAN_DETECT
NC   | GND
PWM  | FAN_ROTATION_DETECT

This server has a weird issue where even though the server is off fan 6 receives 8-9V and since arduino shuts off the fan gets no PWM and goes to full speed.
Easiest fix is to apply power from fans +12v pin to arduino VIN pin so arduino stays on with the fan and sets its speed to 15% or whatever is default. In future arduino code I could see if I could detect this condition and make it fully stop the fan.

### DL380E G8 & DL360E G8
GND  | FAN_ROTATION_DETECT
PWM  | FAN_DETECT
+12V | NC
